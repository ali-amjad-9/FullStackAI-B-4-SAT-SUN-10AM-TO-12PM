Feature Selection
Here, you need to divide given columns into two types of variables dependent(or target variable) and independent variable(or feature variables).

To understand model performance, dividing the dataset into a training set and a test set is a good strategy.

Let's split the dataset by using the function train_test_split(). You need to pass three parameters features; target, and test_set size."""

Evaluating the Model
Let's estimate how accurately the classifier or model can predict the type of cultivars.

Accuracy can be computed by comparing actual test set values and predicted values.

You can use Scikit-learn's export_graphviz function for display the tree within a Jupyter notebook. For plotting the tree, you also need to install graphviz and pydotplus.

The export_graphviz function converts the decision tree classifier into a dot file, and pydotplus converts this dot file to png or displayable form on Jupyter."""
